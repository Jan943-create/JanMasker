<p>Adidas Yeezy is a fashion collaboration between German sportswear company Adidas and American designer, rapper, entrepreneur and personality Kanye West. The collaboration has become notable for its high-end limited edition colorways and general releases offered by the Yeezy Boost sneakers lineup. The collaboration has also produced shirts, jackets, track pants, socks, slides, women's shoes and slippers. The first shoe model ("Boost 750") was released in February 2015.

Kanye West originally designed a shoe for Adidas in 2006, but it was never released. The first brand to officially collaborate with Kanye West was Bape. Together, West and Bape released a pair of Bapesta "College Dropout" shoes, which are now quite rare and garner high resell prices. He has also designed shoes for Louis Vuitton and Giuseppe Zanotti, and (most notably) Nike. His collaboration with Nike lasted for five years and led to the release of a total of three (two silhouettes, the Air Yeezy 1 and the Air Yeezy 2) sneaker styles.

In 2013, after the release of the "Red October" Air Yeezy 2s, Kanye West officially left Nike. Although West described this break as "heartbreaking", he claimed that Nike would not pay him royalties for his shoe designs, instead offering to pay some of the proceeds to a charity of West's choice. This ultimately led West to reach out to Adidas. Adidas agreed to give him royalties, and West described the CEO of Adidas as "someone who allowed him to build something". Under the partnership with Adidas, West retains 100% ownership of his brand while having full creative control over the products released.

In February 2015, a year and three months after the confirmation of the Adidas and Kanye West collaboration, the collaboration officially debuted. "Yeezy Season 1" was highly anticipated and celebrities such as Rihanna, Diddy, and West's wife Kim Kardashian were at the showing. "Yeezy Season 2" and "Yeezy Season 3" also saw notable amounts of success upon their releases.
In June 2016, West and Adidas announced an extension of the deal and the launch of a new Yeezy categor
By 2019, sales for Yeezyâ€™s Adidas sneakers generated $1.3 billion in annual revenue.

In 2020, sales for the sneakers reached nearly $1.7 billion in annual revenue, netting Yeezy $191 million in royalties.
