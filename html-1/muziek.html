    <p class="cool">Kanye west was born in Atlanta (Georgia) on June 8, 1977.
      Ye started producing in the 90's when he was almost exclusively making beats for budding local artists. His first official production was eight tracks from the 1996 album Down to Earth by Chicago rapper Grav. For a while, Ye acted as D-Dot's ghost producer. His work for D-Dot prevented West from developing a solo career, so he joined the Go-Getters, a Chicago rap group.

      Ye really broke through in the 2000s when he started producing for Roc-A-Fella in 2003, but his desire was to become a rapper. His breakthrough in the rap scene came after the near-fatal accident Ye had on the night of October 23-24, 2002. He was driving home from the studio in California where he fell asleep at the wheel. The accident shattered his entire teeth and he underwent reconstructive surgery. After the accident, he recorded the song Through The Wire while his mouth was still sewn shut. He initially released this song on his mixtape Get Well Soon. After this incident, he decided to fully concentrate on rapping and started working on his debut album The College Dropout.
